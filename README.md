# Link shortener website
Optimizing the length of your website's URLs is useful on space-sensitive forums, helps websites rank better in search results, and are also easier for users to type out.I learned about this project from the website ([DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/link-shortener-website-brqjanf6zq)) and developed it.
